This is a collection of benchmark programs to test/evaluate the Patmos
processor -- although other processor configurations are supported as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Requirements

 - LLVM and Clang for either Sparc, PowerPc, or Patmos
   http://www.llvm.org/

 - Absint a3 tools (optional)
   http://www.absint.com/a3/index.htm

 - LLVM, Clang, and NewLib for Patmos (optional)
   https://github.com/t-crest/patmos-llvm
   https://github.com/t-crest/patmos-clang
   https://github.com/t-crest/patmos-newlib

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Configure and build

  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make

For a list of pre-defined compiler/processor toolchain configurations see the
cmake directory (currently leon3-clang, mpc5554-cland, patmos-cland). To chose
one of them use:

  cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/<processor>-clang-toolchain.cmake


Additional search paths can be provided using the -DCMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH=<path>
option.

Have fun!
