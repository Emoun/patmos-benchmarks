Maelardalen WCET Benchmarks
---------------------------

The benchmarks in the src directory have been adapted as follows:
- Fixed compiler warnings
- Exit Code 0 on expected result, 1 otherwise
- If Macro PRINT_RESULTS is defined, print out the results
- If Macro TIMING is defined, time routine and print measurements
- Fixed the following bugs:
* bsort100: the check whether the array is successfully/unsuccessfully sorted is wrong
* duff: to/from need to be switched
* fft1: changed name of reserve function log
* lms: changed name of reserved functions log,fabs,sin

List of benchmarks using floating points (without TIMING):
- fft
- lms
- ludcmop
- minver
- qsort-exam
- qurt
- select
- sqrt
- statemate
=> No print/check results for floating point benchmarks at the moment
