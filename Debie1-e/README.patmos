Changes:
* Defining PATMOS_TEST enables a limited amount of trace output we use for
  comparison with reference output during a functionality test.
* When buildind for WCET analysis, prevent some inlining of analysis entries.
* asm inline labels like,
    __asm volatile (".debie1_3b_loop:");
  are not compatible with compiler optimizations that duplicate code. They are
  commented out for now.
